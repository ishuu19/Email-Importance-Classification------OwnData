    "### A little backgroung\n",
    "I have asked 8 of my friends about one thing that they would want to be automated or done through machine learning. 3 of them said that they get many unnecessary emails everyday and they were asking for a tool that would classify emails for them and would only send them notifications if they are important. Based on that, we started our journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "These are actual emails we got from my hkbu and personal email. There are 4 columns left after cleaning the data. I have removed any links that were in the data. unfortunately we could not get the images from the emails. \n",
    "Now based on our interest in emails, we have classified them and gave them an importance value.\n",
    "##### 0.0 -> this represents spam\n",
    "##### 1.0 -> represents any marketing emails from differnt companies and most of the times we donot want to see them.\n",
    "##### 2.0 -> emails from our univeristy that seems like marketing. this ones are a little more validated.\n",
    "##### 3.0 -> these are internship related emails. mostly from our university.\n",
    "##### 4.0 -> These are emails from our classmates, university professors regarding any courses\n",
    "##### 5.0 -> You might think that these are the most important ones which is partially true. These are all emails from our banks, students halls, internship offer letters and related.\n",
